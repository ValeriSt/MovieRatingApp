# MovieRatingApp
MovieRatingApp is an application to display a list of favorite movies and their rating using the MVVM approach.
For this project I haven't used a dedicated database and decided to store all the data in different JSON files.
# How to use
When you make a Registration and afterwards Login into the page you'll have to click on the "Show Movies" button to show the list of Movies.
To see more about a Movie you'll have to click on it and it'll directly show the Detail page where you can find some more information about that Movie.
At the bottom of this detail page you'll see a "Rate here" button out of which will come a Popup window where you'll have to set the Rating you want to give using a Slider.
After you save the rating you want to give to the supposed movie you'll not be let to Edit anymore so be mindful of that.
